# MigraDoc.Extensions

Extensions for [MigraDoc/PDFSharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/Overview.ashx).

## Remark
The tests are not updated to include the new support for html nested lists!
Use on your own risk!

The included example project is update to have different example of nested lists.

## Quick Start

The biggest feature provided by this library is the ability to convert from HTML and Markdown to PDF, via MigraDoc's Document Object Model.

MigraDoc.Extensions makes use of [MarkdownSharp](https://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/) to convert from Markdown to HTML and the [Html Agility Pack](http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) to convert from HTML to PDF.

Since the MigraDoc DOM is pretty basic, much of the conversion involves setting the `Style` of generated MigraDoc `Paragraph` instances. You can then configure these styles however you like. See the [example project](https://github.com/benfoster/MigraDoc.Extensions/blob/master/src/examples/MigraDoc.Extensions.Html.Example/Program.cs#L44) for more details.

#### Converting from Markdown to PDF

Import the `MigraDoc.Extensions.Markdown` namespace and call `AddMarkdown` on a MigraDoc `Section` instance:


	var markdown = @"
		# This is a heading

		This is some **bold** ass text with a [link](http://www.google.com).

		- List Item 1
		- List Item 2
		- List Item 3

		Pretty cool huh?
	";

	section.AddMarkdown(markdown);


#### Converting from HTML to PDF

Import the `MigraDoc.Extensions.Html` namespace and call `AddHtml` on a MigraDoc `Section` instance:


	var html = @"
		<h1>This is a heading</h1>

		<p>This is some **bold** ass text with a <a href='http://www.google.com'>link</a>.<p>

		<ul>
			<li>List Item 1</li>
			<li>List Item 2</li>
			<li>List Item 3</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Pretty cool huh?</p>
	";

	section.AddHtml(html);
	
#### What is supported?

The HTML converter currently supports the following:

- Headings (H1 -> H6) - Sets a "HeadingX" style on the generated paragraph
- Paragraphs
- Hyperlinks containing plain text or supported inline elements
- Lists - Adds a paragraph with style "ListStart" before the list and one with style "ListEnd" after the list.
  - Unordered Lists - Each list item has the style "UnorderedList"
  - Ordered Lists - Each list item has the style "Ordered List"
- Line breaks 
- Inline elements `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<i>`, `<u>`
- Horizontal Rules - Adds a paragraph with style "HorizontalRule"

For more details, check out the [specs](https://github.com/benfoster/MigraDoc.Extensions/blob/master/src/specs/MigraDoc.Extensions.Html.Specs/converting_tags.cs).


#### Extending the HTML converter

To add a custom handler, create a new instance of `HtmlConverter` and add to its `NodeHandlers` dictionary. The key is the HTML element you wish to handle and the value is a `Func<HtmlNode, DocumentObject, DocumentObject`.

The `DocumentObject` instance passed to the handler is the parent object in the MigraDoc DOM, usually a `Section` or `Paragraph` (you may need to cater for both). The return value should be the `DocumentObject` that was created. This will be passed as the parent for any child elements. 

Here is the handler for processing a `<strong>` element:

    nodeHandlers.Add("strong", (node, parent) => {
        var format = TextFormat.Bold;
        
        var formattedText = parent as FormattedText;
        if (formattedText != null)
        {
            return formattedText.Format(format);
        }

        // otherwise parent is paragraph or section
        return GetParagraph(parent).AddFormattedText(format);
    });

In the above handler, we need to cater for nested format tags (e.g. `<strong><em>some text</em></strong>`) so we first attempt to cast the parent as `FormattedText`, otherwise fall back to adding formatted text to a `Paragraph`. Unfortunately such type checks are fairly frequent due to the limited relationships between objects in the MigraDoc DOM.

To use a custom converter instance use the `Section.Add(string content, IConverter converter)` extension in the `MigraDoc.Extensions` namespace.

Note that an element handler should not process any inner HTML. For example the handler for a `<h1>` tag only adds a paragraph with a the style "Heading1", it does not add the text (there is a separate handler for processing text nodes).
